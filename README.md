# Home_automation_ASIMO
Home Automation using the deep learning AI that triggers the action based on the user Hotwords. This project uses a deep network of convolutional Neural Network that converts the speech into spectrographic images that has the base frequency components of a sound and then apply those pixel values of the images to the Input Neurons for the classification Machine Learning technique and then based on the keywords given it does the task. I here used the word "ASIMO' to trigger my Light that is connected to 240V mains.Used embedded linux to Run the neural networks and control the lights based on the outputs of the NN using a relay (solenoid switch ) .
